<h3>How Can I Become an Instructor?</h3>
<p>
You do not need a degree to be an instructor, but you do have to first submit an outline of your course's curriculum. To propose a new course, or offer to teach an existing course please contact <a href="mailto:loquntia@gmail.com">loquntia@gmail.com</a>. You can also found a program of study, or a certification.
</p>

<h3>Do I Have to Actively Teach?</h3>
<p>
You do not need to actively teach. You can create a course which students must study by themselves, and all you have to do is grade the students on their comprehension of the course material.
