<h2>University of Loquntia</h2>
<p>
The University of Loquntia is a guild of scholars consisting of both students and instructors who specialise in studies that are important to the micronational world. Courses such as Vexillology, Micronational Law, Constructed Languages and Linguistics, as well as free tutoring are among the many services offered to members of the UL.
</p>

<h3>How Can I Join?</h3>
<p>
Go to <a href="http://ul.boards.net">ul.boards.net</a> and set up an account. A list of courses is available under the Course Catalogue board. To join a course, use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1saA8hduFGvN44cu8rxhknAX2OJDjuPmxuKJEhXZvy9Y/viewform">this form</a>.
</p>

<h3>How Can I Become an Instructor?</h3>
<p>
You do not need a degree to be an instructor, but you do have to first submit an outline of your course's curriculum. To propose a new course, or offer to teach an existing course please contact <a href="mailto:loquntia@gmail.com">loquntia@gmail.com</a>. You can also design a program of study, a group of classes which must be taken in order to receive a certain certification.
</p>

<h3>Do I Have to Actively Teach?</h3>
<p>
You do not need to actively teach. You can create a course which students must study by themselves, and all you have to do is grade the students on their comprehension of the course material.
</p>

<h3>What About Administrative Positions?</h3>
<p>
The University of Loquntia could always use more help. If you would like to apply for an administrative position, please contact <a href="mailto:loquntia@gmail.com">loquntia@gmail.com</a>. Currently, the only administrative positions we are looking for are Registrar and Deputy Chancellor.
