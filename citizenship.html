<p><b>Please read all of the information on this page before applying for citizenship.</b></p>

<h2>Step One: TPSN</h2>
<p>
In Loquntia, anyone can get a Taxable Person's Serial Number and be given all of the privileges and immunities of a royal subject. To acheive this, you must fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Tm0pSDuuvxa7S9w7tJNLTNXBh94HT3DFKu50lx4kn5I/viewform">ET103 Taxable Person's Serial Number form</a>. You will be required to supply your legal name, the TPSN class you are applying for, your date of birth, your nationality, and a email address you can be reached at in order to send you your TPSN certificate.

<h3>TPSN Classes</h3>
There are 4 classes of TPSN which must be taken into consideration, namely:
<ul>
<li>TPSN-N :: <i>This is a normal TPSN for prospective citizens or anyone who wants to be a royal subject</i></li>
<li>TPSN-S :: <i>This is used for international students, and expires 720 days after issue</i></li>
<li>TPSN-C :: <i>This is used to register corporations, a person may not get a TPSN-C</i></li>
<li>TPSN-M :: <i>This is given to those who enroll in the Loquntian military and automatically makes you eligible for citizenship</i></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Step Two: Naturalisation</h2>
<p>
After you have attained a TPSN, you may apply to be a naturalised citizen. In order to apply, you must fill out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1C20p532-x_tw8qVAkocCFuDkWfDLCXSu9NqlUkUvQxs/viewform">EIS-31 Application for Citizenship form</a>. You will be required to answer multiple personal questions to see if you qualify for citizenship under the Classification of Persons Act.
</p>

<h2>Alternative Routes to Citizenship: Military Enlistment</h2>
<p>
By joining the Loquntian Military, you will automatically be granted de facto citizenship. The first step to joining is filling out an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmtgDiPpD_UHU42ZydwPI9kgT_nZRIAGW0hIMFxeDLLXnjBA/viewform">EM990 Application for Military Enlistment form</a>. In addition to citizenship, you will also be paid into a National Bank of Loquntia account for your service. To create an account fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5YLfcAQsshNoY22O73nIvDvpPgDKkoWgHXZHlNLgBDkgQYw/viewform">this application</a>.
</p>

<h2>Alternative Routes to Citizenship: Marriage</h2>
<p>
By receiving a marriage certificate from the Loquntian Crown, even if the two people getting married aren't Loquntian citizens, you will both be given Loquntia citizenship. To inquire about Loquntian marriage, or if you have any questions about citizenship, feel free to contact <a href="mailto:loquntia@gmail.com">mailto:loquntia@gmail.com</a>.
