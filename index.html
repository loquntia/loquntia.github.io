	<h2>Founding</h2>
<p>
The Kingdom of Loquntia has begun the process of moving its online infrastructure to this new site. This may take some time, but all of our online services will be available at loquntia.weebly.com in the meantime.

<h2>The Wiki Problem</h2>
<p>
A conflict led a mass group of micronation representatives and sovereigns from favouring the original Wikia-based MicroWiki to a new MicroWiki run by the already-existing Micronation.org.

<ul>
<li><h3>Micronation.org</h3>
<p>
"<a href="http://mw.micronation.org/wiki/Main_Page">MicroWiki</a> is the largest online encyclopedia about micronations, small and often rather eccentric nations that are unrecognised by the wider international community. The wiki is being continually improved and updated as the community changes constantly with content being moderated by a small group of staff. Since its creation in 2005, the site has grown to become one of the largest micronational-related websites with a total of 31,687 pages and 7,816 articles, of which 42 have achieved good article status."</li>

<li><h3>Wikia</h3>
<p>
"<a href="http://micronations.wikia.com/">MicroWiki</a> is an encyclopedia centered on the subject of <i>micronationalism</i>, which is collaboratively written by micronationalists and non-micronationalists alike. The wiki is maintained by a small group of specially selected contributors—whose job it is to make sure things run as smoothly as humanly possible.
<p>
"MicroWiki was established May 27, 2005 by Fabian Schneider, and is one of the largest online encyclopedias about micronationalism, with 78,480 pages and 2,379 articles. All written content on this site is published under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License 3.0."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Micronation.org</h2>
<p>
Micronation.org is the equivalent of the United Nations for Micronations. Both the most revered and infamous micronations have an online personality on their three sites:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mw.micronation.org/">Micronation.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://micronation.org/">mw.Micronation.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://forum.micronation.org/">Micronations Forum</a></li>
</ul>
